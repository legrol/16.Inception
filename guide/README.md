# Inception Guide

This guide has been made using as its base the guide by pgomez-r at https://github.com/pgomez-r/inception. 

It would be fair to give pgomez-r a star if this guide is helpful to you.

This guide only covers the mandatory part, since the bonus does not do it.

## Project steps

> The idea of this guide is to first set our working environment, which will consist of installing and setting the VM with all necessary packages and configurations; then we will move to Docker basic concept and will set each container but on its own, and the last stage will be -once each container is working properly by itself- to connect all of them and finish all configurations and subject requirements.
